# Requirement Specification Document

## Problem Statement 

> Write a few sentences that describes the problem you are trying to solve. In other words, justify why this software project is needed.


## Potential Clients
> Who are affected by this problem (and would benefit from the proposed solution)? I.e. the potential users of the software you are going to build.


## Proposed Solution
> Write a few sentences that describes how a software solution will solve the problem described above.

A web-based application will be used to solve this problem. Our application takes inputs from users (e.g., major, year of study, courses they have taken, interested areas of focus, expected graduation year) and connects with the universityâ€™s degree audit system as well as the course registration system to fetch program requirements and course information, and then it will use our built-in intelligence algorithm to recommend an optimal course schedules for each upcoming semester through a calendar view. 

## Functional Requirements
> List the (functional) requirements that software needs to have in order to solve the problem stated above. It is useful to write the requirements in form of **User Stories** and group them into those that are essential (must have), and those which are non-essential (but nice to have).


### Must have



### Nice to have


## Software Architecture
> Will this be a Web/desktop/mobile (all, or some other kind of) application? Would it conform to the Client-Server software architecture?
