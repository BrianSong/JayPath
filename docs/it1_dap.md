- As a student, I want to see a list of courses that I'm eligible for in the next semester so that I can choose between them.
- As a student, I want to determine the number of courses I want to take each semester so that I can evenly distribute remaining courses to each semester.
- As a student, I want to receive a schedule that follows my interest, so that I can directly use it as my plan.
