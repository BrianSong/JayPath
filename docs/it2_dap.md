## Iteration Backlog
- As a student, I want to input the courses I have taken so that the application knows my current progress.
- As a student, I want to see multiple recommended schedules so that I get the flexibility to choose between them. 
- As a student, I want to receive a schedule that doesnâ€™t contain time conflicts, so that I can directly use it as my plan.

## Tasks
- Implement a simple version of course recommendation algorithm that outputs recommendations for next semester.
- Add interfaces that allow users to input the courses he/she has taken.
- Add all course infomation to database.
